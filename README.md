# Android Mining
Quick installation and setup of ccminer on Android Phones.

## Installation
1. Download & install latest arm64-v8a [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.0/termux-app_v0.118.0+github-debug_arm64-v8a.apk):
```
https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.0/termux-app_v0.118.0+github-debug_arm64-v8a.apk
```
2. Get Termux ready:
- Type `y` then enter key in any prompts!
3. From within Termux, run:
```bash
curl -o- -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkashro/verus-mining/main/install.sh | bash
```

Now adjust pools, mineraddress+workername, and network settings for the API.
exit with `<CTRL>-X` followed by `y` and an `<ENTER>`
```bash
nano config.json
```

# Usage:

1. Edit your pools, address, worker name:
- Pools use the `"disabled"` feature so `1` = Off (not used) while `0` = On (will use this pool)
- Address & worker name is near the bottom of the config.json in format `address here.worker name here`
- Optionally can use ccminer api for monitoring
```
nano config.json
```
2. Start mining with `~/ccminer/start.sh`
